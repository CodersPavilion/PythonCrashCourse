# PythonCrashCourse

## Presented by: Coders Pavilion
<hr>

We are a group of graduates from IITs/NITs, who aim to provide free teachings for the technical skills to the students, who are willing to learn.

Currently, we have chosen youtube lectures and github to track content, based on the suggestions. As of now, it’s in the form of 1 week crash courses.

The target is to eventually expand this to provide more better content with a lot of different means such as live discussions, doubts clarifications, etc.
